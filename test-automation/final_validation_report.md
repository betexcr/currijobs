## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: React Components Not Rendering
The main issue is that while the Expo server is running and serving HTML, the React components (including the mascot, forms, and navigation) are not rendering properly in the web version.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Expo Router Configuration**: The app may not be properly configured for web
2. **React Native Web**: Missing or incorrect web dependencies
3. **Babel Configuration**: Still some configuration issues
4. **Environment Variables**: Supabase configuration may be affecting rendering

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### 1. Check Expo Router Configuration
```bash
# Verify expo-router is properly configured
npx expo install expo-router
```

### 2. Update Dependencies
```bash
# Update to compatible versions
npx expo install --fix
```

### 3. Clear All Caches
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npx expo start --clear

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
```

### 4. Test iOS Simulator First
The iOS simulator is more likely to work properly than the web version.

## ✅ Success Criteria

For the project to be considered complete:

- [ ] All test cases pass in iOS Simulator
- [ ] Mascot appears consistently throughout the app
- [ ] All forms work correctly
- [ ] Navigation between screens works
- [ ] Database operations work (if Supabase is configured)
- [ ] UI is responsive and user-friendly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] App runs smoothly

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test in iOS Simulator**: This is the primary testing method
2. **Fix Web Version**: Address React component rendering issues
3. **Validate All Features**: Ensure all Phase III features work
4. **Document Issues**: Create detailed bug report if needed
5. **Prepare for Phase IV**: Once all tests pass, move to Maps & Geo Discovery
