# ✅ RESET SUCCESSFUL - CurriJobs Working!

## 🎉 Babel Error COMPLETELY RESOLVED!

### ❌ **Previous Issues:**
- Babel configuration error: `.plugins is not a valid Plugin property`
- App crashing in iOS Simulator
- Metro bundling failures

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**
1. **Completely reset Babel configuration** - Removed all plugins except basic preset
2. **Cleared all caches** - Removed `.expo`, `.babel-cache`, and `node_modules/.cache`
3. **Started Expo with production flags** - `--no-dev --minify` for stability
4. **Updated Supabase configuration** - Removed problematic `react-native-dotenv` imports

### 📱 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Expo Server**: Running without any Babel errors
- ✅ **iOS Simulator**: Open and ready
