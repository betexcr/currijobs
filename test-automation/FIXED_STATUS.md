# ✅ FIXED - CurriJobs Ready for iOS Simulator Testing!

## 🎉 Babel Error RESOLVED!

### ❌ **Previous Error:**
```
ERROR node_modules/expo-router/entry.js: [BABEL] /Users/albertomunoz/Documents/Code/currijobs/currijobs/node_modules/expo-router/entry.js: .plugins is not a valid Plugin property
```

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**
1. **Removed problematic `react-native-dotenv` plugin** from `babel.config.js`
2. **Updated `lib/supabase.ts`** to use hardcoded environment variables instead of importing from `react-native-dotenv`
3. **Cleared Expo cache** and restarted server

### 📱 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Expo Server**: Running without errors
- ✅ **iOS Simulator**: Open and ready
- ✅ **No Babel Errors**: Clean startup
- ✅ **All Features**: Complete Phase III implementation
